# WISHLIST BACKEND TEST

given that one of the most interesting features of an e-commerce 
is the wish list, where from the product screen or product details, 
the user is able to add that product to their wish list.

Since because it is a microservice, the product information and user logged in 
will be managed by other services, this API therefore treats these 
entities as Id's and saves them to a Nosql bank (mongoDb) 
including creation date.

The API was developed using the concepts of a REST API, clean architecture, and BDD
The database will run into a mongo docker container if you want to change the connection, 
simply change the settings in application.properties.

## Getting Started
